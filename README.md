# Boiler-Space
It is a tool designed to simplify the process of creating and setting up new projects by providing an initial structure (boilerplate) with essential files and recommended configurations.

This project automates repetitive setup tasks, enabling developers to focus on building features instead of spending time manually configuring the environment.
